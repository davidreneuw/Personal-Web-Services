# Personal-Web-Services

The goal of this repository would be to create a "hub" of small web-services. These web services would be hosted on a small Raspberry Pi Zero W that I own. With this project, I hope to gain experience in web development using NodeJs.

A few examples of web services that I would like to implement:
 - A local multiplayer chess game that uses an API hosted on the Raspberry Pi.
 - A local multiplayer tetris game.
 - A singleplayer sudoku game.

These examples are great but I would also like to use this project to experiment with hardware. A few ideas I had relating to hardware:
 - Attach a display to the Raspberry Pi to display gifs or videos (possibly with audio) using an online form.
 - Creating a web page where I can keep track of when my plants were last watered, and then using a pump, automatically water each plant every so often.
